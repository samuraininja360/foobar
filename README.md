# Google Foobar
## What is Foobar

Google Foobar is a secret programming challenge for Python and Java developers.
Google sends a challenge to skilled Python and Java developers that might be 
useful to their organisation!

Type arraylist java in Google Chrome and search it at least 20 times. You might
get an invitation.

(Foobar is invitation only!)
## My Solutions

If you manage to access Foobar these python scripts can be used to solve some of
the challenges. The challenges can be solved in Java or Python (I prefer Python).
Make sure your code is a function that can be run by a filerunner.py.
